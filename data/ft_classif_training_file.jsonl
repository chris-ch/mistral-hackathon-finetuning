A.________ also complained that the police officers who later intervened left him shirtless for too long in the cold and with handcuffs that were too tight, causing him severe pain in his left wrist. Finally, he claimed that police officers refused to register the complaint he wanted to file against B.________ and tried to dissuade him from doing so directly with the public prosecutor. After conducting various investigative acts, including police interviews as a witness of D.________ (on July 9, 2018), as a suspect of B.________ (on September 4, 2018), and as persons called to provide information, respectively on April 4 and December 19, 2019, the public prosecutor informed the parties of his intention to dismiss the complaint, with costs to be borne by the State, which he did by order of June 18, 2020. In short, he considered, regarding the intervention of B.________, that the investigation had established that the complainant had not accepted being denied entry to the club on the grounds that he did not have identification and had refused to leave the premises. He had been more than insistent in attempting multiple times to enter the nightclub and had not complied with the orders to leave given by the security guards. The intervention of the suspect had been appropriate and proportionate even though the complainant had been insistent. B.________'s statements were also corroborated by those of E.________ and by the surveillance camera footage. As for the two colleagues of the security guard, there was no evidence in the file to suggest that the second security guard at the club on the night of the incident had physically attacked the complainant. When the complainant reappeared in the camera's view after the intervention of this guard, he was standing and had no injuries. The surveillance camera footage clearly showed that this guard was inside the nightclub at the time the suspect and the complainant ended up on the ground, which is why E.________ intervened. As for the latter, the Prosecutor noted that the surveillance camera footage showed that he had merely grabbed the complainant's legs and then held him down and handcuffed him. Handcuffing the complainant while waiting for the police to arrive did not appear disproportionate given his behavior. Furthermore, the complainant had provided no evidence of injuries caused by improper handcuffing. Thirdly, no evidence corroborated the complainant's claims that B.________ had made threats. On the contrary, it seemed more likely that it was the complainant who had behaved inappropriately. In the presence of irreconcilably contradictory versions, the suspect had to be given the benefit of the doubt. No evidence in the file corroborated that the complainant had been injured by handcuffs that were too tight. As for leaving him shirtless,'\n\nThe possible categories values are : 'Civil', 'Criminal' or 'Public'.

He entered into contracts with X (plaintiff) as the contractor and project manager. \n\nB.\nThe parties disputed the amount of payment, the scope of the project management, and whether the project management was done negligently. The plaintiff filed a lawsuit on June 26, 2009, seeking payment of approximately CHF 62,510.16 (or EUR 37,885.20) plus interest. The defendant denied the claim and counterclaimed for the return of overpaid fees and damages, at least CHF 147,000 plus interest. The District Court of Kriens ruled on July 18, 2012, that the defendant must pay the plaintiff CHF 62,510.60 plus interest and dismissed the counterclaim. On the defendant's appeal, the Higher Court of the Canton of Lucerne awarded the plaintiff only CHF 9,042 and dismissed the counterclaim. It ordered the plaintiff to pay 16% of the first-instance costs and one-fourth of the second-instance costs.\n\nC.\nThe plaintiff filed an appeal with the Federal Court on April 30, 2013, seeking to overturn the Higher Court's decision and to have the defendant ordered to pay CHF 58,405.90 plus interest. The plaintiff also challenged the allocation of costs in the first-instance proceedings, arguing that a pre-litigation settlement proposal should have been considered under cantonal law. Regarding the interest, the plaintiff argued that the Higher Court did not award any interest on the amount granted, even though the first-instance decision did not raise any objections in this regard. On May 27, 2013, the Higher Court corrected its decision in accordance with the reasoning contained therein and awarded the plaintiff interest on the amount of CHF 9,042 from January 8, 2008. The defendant requests that the appeal be dismissed with costs. In the event that the appeal is found to be justified, he criticizes various aspects of the contested decision that were unfavorable to him. He also argues in the response to the appeal that he should have been obligated to pay EUR 5,480 instead of CHF 9,042. The Higher Court refers to the correction decision and rejects the imposition of costs, as a short letter would have sufficed to remedy this defect. To the extent that the appeal has not become moot due to the correction, the Higher Court requests that it be dismissed with costs.'\n\nThe possible categories values are : 'Civil', 'Criminal' or 'Public'.

The court stated that the current risk of self-harm or harm to others is not sufficiently concrete to justify the continuation of the involuntary placement, and the complainant's weakened state can be addressed with daily medication or depot medication, to which she has agreed. On June 7, 2022, the complainant filed an appeal with the Federal Court.'\n\nThe possible categories values are : 'Civil', 'Criminal' or 'Public'.

I filed a complaint for delay or denial of justice with the Appenzell Ausserrhoden Higher Court on May 8, 2017. The Higher Court informed me on July 5, 2017 that the cantonal court had taken over the custody and visitation rights proceedings that were previously pending with the child and adult protection authority, and had merged them with the ongoing maintenance proceedings before the cantonal court. The complaint for delay or denial of justice against the child and adult protection authority is therefore irrelevant, and there is no delay of justice with the cantonal court, so the appeal proceedings will be dismissed as irrelevant in the near future. The appeal against the denial or delay of justice was dismissed by the Federal Court in judgment 5A_631/2017 of October 2, 2017, on the grounds that a mere letter was challenged and a soon-to-be decision by the Higher Court was promised, which could then be challenged. The Higher Court issued this decision on November 2, 2017 in the form of a dismissal of the complaint for delay or denial of justice, stating that there is no current and practical interest in establishing this, as the cantonal court is now responsible for regulating visitation rights. A.________ filed an appeal against this decision on December 5, 2017, requesting its annulment and the establishment of a delay of justice in the pending proceedings regarding visitation and custody rights, as well as the issuance of a well-founded decision on visitation arrangements within 30 days. The Higher Court and the cantonal court waived their right to submit a statement in response to the appeal in letters dated December 12 and 14, 2017, respectively. The child and adult protection authority did not respond to the invitation to submit a statement.'\n\nThe possible categories values are : 'Civil', 'Criminal' or 'Public'.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are an expert lawyer tasked with classifying various cases into three differents category based on the case description.\n\nCase description: 'On December 6, 2018, A.________ filed a complaint with the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office. On March 7, 2019, the Public Prosecutor's Office of the Republic and Canton of Geneva agreed to take over the proceedings at the request of the federal authority. A.________ subsequently completed her complaint on May 29 and November 1, 2019.\n\nIn summary, presenting herself as a private bank u.________, owned since 2014, she stated that she had belonged between 1998 and 2008 to B.________, a u.________ national of unknown residence; in 2008, due to financial losses caused by the aforementioned in the amount of 'billions', a u.________ sovereign fund had temporarily taken over. B.________ had been its majority shareholder and de facto manager between 2005 and 2009, during which time he allegedly enriched himself at her expense to the tune of USD 10 billion, before fleeing to V.________. These actions allegedly resulted in his conviction in U.________ to 20 years in prison in 2017, and then to 17 years in prison in 2018. A.________ accused various individuals or entities domiciled in W.________, including C.________, of participating in money laundering of the diverted funds to her detriment in U.________ and obstructing the efforts of 'public authorities' to confiscate funds for her benefit. She relied on a judgment rendered in V.________ on June 21, 2018, ordering C.________ to pay her over USD 500 million in damages, to assert the existence of 'serious suspicions' that the alleged money laundering activities took place in Switzerland during the years 2012 and 2013.\n\nBy order of November 21, 2019, the public prosecutor's office refused to consider the criminal complaint of December 6, 2018, and its supplements of May 29 and November 1, 2019. In summary, it considered that the file did not establish the criminal origin of the assets in Switzerland.\n\nBy judgment of January 21, 2020, the Criminal Appeals Chamber of the Court of Justice of the Republic and Canton of Geneva dismissed the bank's appeal against the order of November 21, 2019, noting in particular that the allegations and evidence of the complaining party were devoid of any indication supporting a prior crime to the reported money laundering. The allegation that a u.________ sovereign fund had entered its capital in 2009 and that it had been cleaned up also raised serious doubts about the current existence of its financial loss.\n\nBy judgment of June 10, 2020, the Federal Court rejected, to the extent of its admissibility, the appeal filed by A.________ against this last decision (judgment 6B_232/2020 of June 10, 2020). The grounds of the appeal did not allow for a satisfactory understanding of the extent to which the appellant could assert separate civil claims from those awarded to her abroad, and the appellant mainly mentioned the possibility of taking seizure measures for the allocation to the victim, i.e., implementing enforcement measures of judicial decisions. Furthermore, she did not explain to what extent she could still claim compensation for any potential loss after her clean-up. The appeal was therefore inadmissible from this perspective.

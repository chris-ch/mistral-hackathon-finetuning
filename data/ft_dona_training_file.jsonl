{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "On March 27, 2018, A._______ filed a criminal complaint against a security guard at the nightclub C.________ in U.________, as well as against the police officers who intervened against him on the same day, around 3:00 am, in front of the establishment. In summary, a security guard (B.________) allegedly threatened him, after refusing him entry to the establishment, to drag him out of the cameras view and beat him up. He attempted to do so and two of his colleagues came to his aid. Furthermore, the security guard and his colleagues allegedly completely undressed the upper half of his body, hit him, and restrained him with overly tight handcuffs. A.________ also complained that the police officers who later intervened left him shirtless for too long in the cold and with handcuffs that were too tight, causing him severe pain in his left wrist. Finally, he claimed that police officers refused to register the complaint he wanted to file against B.________ and tried to dissuade him from doing so directly with the public prosecutor. After conducting various investigative acts, including police interviews as a witness of D.________ (on July 9, 2018), as a suspect of B.________ (on September 4, 2018), and as persons called to provide information, respectively on April 4 and December 19, 2019, the public prosecutor informed the parties of his intention to dismiss the complaint, with costs to be borne by the State, which he did by order of June 18, 2020. In short, he considered, regarding the intervention of B.________, that the investigation had established that the complainant had not accepted being denied entry to the club on the grounds that he did not have identification and had refused to leave the premises. He had been more than insistent in attempting multiple times to enter the nightclub and had not complied with the orders to leave given by the security guards. The intervention of the suspect had been appropriate and proportionate even though the complainant had been insistent. B.________s statements were also corroborated by those of E.________ and by the surveillance camera footage. As for the two colleagues of the security guard, there was no evidence in the file to suggest that the second security guard at the club on the night of the incident had physically attacked the complainant. When the complainant reappeared in the cameras view after the intervention of this guard, he was standing and had no injuries. The surveillance camera footage clearly showed that this guard was inside the nightclub at the time the suspect and the complainant ended up on the ground, which is why E.________ intervened. As for the latter, the Prosecutor noted that the surveillance camera footage showed that he had merely grabbed the complainants legs and then held him down and handcuffed him. Handcuffing the complainant while waiting for the police to arrive did not appear disproportionate given his behavior. Furthermore, the complainant had provided no evidence of injuries caused by improper handcuffing. Thirdly, no evidence corroborated the complainants claims that B.________ had made threats. On the contrary, it seemed more likely that it was the complainant who had behaved inappropriately. In the presence of irreconcilably contradictory versions, the suspect had to be given the benefit of the doubt. No evidence in the file corroborated that the complainant had been injured by handcuffs that were too tight. As for leaving him shirtless,"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "**Case Summary:**\n\nOn March 27, 2018, A.________ filed a criminal complaint against a security guard (B.________) at the nightclub \"C.________\" in U.________, and against the police officers who intervened later.

He claimed that B.________, with the help of two colleagues, undressed him, hit him, and restrained him with overly tight handcuffs. A.________ also accused the police officers of leaving him shirtless in the cold and with tight handcuffs, causing severe pain, and of refusing to register his complaint against B.________.\n\nAfter an investigation, including witness interviews and reviewing surveillance footage, the public prosecutor decided to dismiss the complaint on June 18, 2020. The prosecutor found that A.________ had been insistent on entering the club without identification and had not complied with the security guards' orders to leave. The intervention by B.________ was deemed appropriate and proportionate. Surveillance footage and witness statements corroborated B.________'s account, showing no evidence of physical assault by the security guards. The prosecutor also found no evidence of injuries caused by improper handcuffing or threats made by B.________.
